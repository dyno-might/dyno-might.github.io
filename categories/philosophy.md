Like so many of my peers, I've been afflicted by the bad habit of arguing about utilitarianism. I'm generally a supporter of utilitarianism, but I think it needs to be tempered by all sorts of meta/game-theoretic issues and I worry a lot about what's the right thing to do when we can create new utility-having entities.
