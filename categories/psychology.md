People on the internet are always dunking on the Meyers-Briggs quiz, calling it pseudoscience and meaningless and laughing at anyone that believes in it. Typically, people propose to use the Big-5 test instead. Thing is, those two tests are [almost the same thing](/in-defense-of-myers-briggs.html). The main difference is if/how you discretize the axes.  Thus, I proposed a new system to give Myers-Briggs results with a finer discretization.

* To underline this point, I went so far as to create a no-nonsense [MBTI quiz](/mbti/).  Beyond giving a finer discretization, I think this might be the fastest MBTI quiz on the internet, just due to the interface.

I'm also interested in the relative advantages of different personalities. I naively assumed that all personalities are equally "good", just in different ways. To my surprise, the data suggests that [one particular personality](/better-personalities/) is better in almost every way.

I've done a couple of [obsessive investigations](/categories/obsessive-investigation) of topics related to psychology:

1. Is the ["general factor"](/general-intelligence/) of intelligence a real thing?
2. Is the ["gender-equality paradox"](/gender-equality-paradox/) a real thing?

(In both cases, the answer is "probably, but it's not as consequential as some people think").

A particular interest is the impact of evolution on explaining the world around us. Given this, I've tried to understand two different seeming contradictions:

1. Why would [genetic evolution favor the existence of homosexuality while *cultural* evolution favors social norms against homosexuality](/evolution/)? My answer is that I think those trends actually reinforce each other.

2. Why is it that [you're super motivated to marry someone hot, while your parents care so much less about this](/hotness/)? My answer is that there's many possible explanations. (See also [this update/correction](/shorts/#contra-me-on-hot-in-laws).)
