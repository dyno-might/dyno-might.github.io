Wondering what to do with your life? Here's what I suggest:

* First priority: Your physical health. (No health â†’ no life.)
* Second priority: *Reasonable* financial security. (No food â†’ no health.)
* Third priority: Good relationships with friends and family. (Depressed â†’ no mental health.)

After that you can do whatever. The game you're playing doesn't have any rules and there's no way to win.

In general I'm very open to the idea that I got stuff wrong, I think all feedback is a gift, and I change things based on feedback from people all the time. But fans of [methamphetamines](/p2p-meth/) should be forewarned I am not super open-minded about theories in which I am an agent of the Mexican cartels.

Not sure where to get started? Try one of these:

* [Underrated reasons to be thankful I](/thanks/) / [II](/thanks-2/) / [III](/thanks-3/)
* [Plans you're not supposed to talk about](/plans/)
* [Are some personalities just better?](/better-personalities/)
* [Better air is the easiest way not to die](/air/)
* [The big alcohol study that didn't happen: My primal scream of rage](/alcohol-trial/)
