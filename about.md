When every person has a DIY air purifier and every economics concept a coconut-based model, I'll be at peace. Until then, here's what I suggest:

* First priority in life: Your physical health. (No health → no life.)
* Second priority: *Reasonable* financial security. (No food → no health.)
* Third priority: Good relationships with friends and family. (Depressed → no mental health.)

After that you can do whatever. The game you're playing doesn't have any rules, and there's no way to win.
