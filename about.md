Wondering what to do with your life? Here's what I suggest:

* First priority: Your physical health. (No health → no life.)
* Second priority: *Reasonable* financial security. (No food → no health.)
* Third priority: Good relationships with friends and family. (Depressed → no mental health.)

After that you can do whatever. The game you're playing doesn't have any rules, and there's no way to win.

You can subscribe here to get new articles. Owing to the fantastical amount of time they take me to create, there will typically be 2-4 per month. This also gives access to a forum and there's occasionally extra content I don't feel comfortable sharing with the internet.

There's just the one step to subscribe, no second form or confirmation link. (Of course, I don't share your email with anyone and you can unsubscribe whenever.)

In general I'm *very* open to the idea that I got stuff wrong, I think all feedback is a gift, and I change things based on feedback from people all the time. But fans of [methamphetamines](/p2p-meth) should be aware I am not super open-minded about theories in which I am an agent of the Mexican cartels.

Not sure where to get started? Try one of these:

* [Better air is the easiest way not to die](/air/)

The closest thing I have to a "mission statement" is probably [this analogy](/culture-war-island-hopping/) between culture war debates and attacking highly defended islands in the WWII Pacific theater. But it's probably better to start with something below:

**Air quality**

* [The Cuboid: A DIY air purifier that's better than a box-fan](/better-DIY-air-purifier.html)

**Alcohol**

**Psychology**
* [Are some personalities just better?](/better-personalities)
* [In defense of Myers-Briggs](/in-defense-of-myers-briggs.html)
  * [MBTI quiz](/mbti/)

**Personal improvement**
* [How to run without all the pesky agonizing pain](/2021/01/25/how-to-run-without-all-the-agonizing-pain/)

**Things to never do**
* [What happens if you drink acetone?](/2020/09/14/what-happens-if-you-drink-acetone/)
{% endcomment %}

**Made the internet oddly mad** (they're wrong I tell you, all wrong)
