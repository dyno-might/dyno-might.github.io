When every person has a DIY air purifier and every economics concept a coconut-based model, this website will be at peace.

Until then, here's what I suggest:

* First priority in life: Your physical health. (No health → no life.)
* Second priority: *Reasonable* financial security. (No food → no health.)
* Third priority: Good relationships with friends and family. (Lonely and depressed → no mental health.)

After that you can do whatever. The game you're playing doesn't have any rules, and there's no way to win. I'd like it if you didn't worry about being weird, but it's up to you.
