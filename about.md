When every person has a DIY air purifier and every economics concept a coconut-based model, this website will be at peace.

Until then, here's what I suggest:

* First priority in life: Your physical health. (No health → no life.)
* Second priority: *Reasonable* financial security your second priority. (No food → no way to think about anything else.)
* Third priority: Good relationships with friends and family. (Lonely and depressed → no way to do anything else.)

After that you can do whatever. I'd like it if you didn't worry about being weird, but it's up to you.
