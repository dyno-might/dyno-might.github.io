## Physical tests are correlated

I found three studies that give populations batteries of physical tests:

Paper | Population
- | - 
[Ibrahim et al., 2011]((https://doi.org/10.2466/03.06.19.25.pms.113.5.491-508)) | 330 Malaysian students aged 12-15
[Marsh and Redmaye, 1994](https://doi.org/10.1123/jsep.16.1.43) | 105 students at two private girls' schools in Sydney
[Baumgartner and Zuidema, 1972](https://doi.org/10.1080/10671188.1972.10615157) | 283 male and 336 female students at Calvin college in Michigan

Here are the correlations between each pair of tests in all these studies:

(This is males, with tests grouped by color. Females are similar, except with lower correlations in upper-body strength.)

What do we see?

First, **almost everything is positively correlated**. You might imagine that people with more upper-body strength would be worse runners, what with the extra muscle they need to carry around. But that's not what happens.

Second, **more similar stuff is more correlated**. It's not a huge surprise that chin-ups are strongly correlated with pull-ups, or that shuttle run speed is correlated to shuttle run speed with an object.

Third, **the result is robust**. These experiments span 40 years, three countries, and three test batteries, yet give the same basic pattern.

## Mental tests are correlated

We can do the same thing with mental tests. I found four studies, that look at various populations and use different batteries of tests.

Paper | Population
- | - 
[Alderton et al. 1997](https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327876mp0901_1) | 12,813 members of the US Navy, Army and Air Forces
[Deary, 2000](https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198524175.001.0001) |  365 representative Scottish people[^1]
[Chabris 2011](http://www.chabris.com/Chabris2007a.pdf) | 111 Boston adults 18 - 60 years old
[MacCann et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1037/a0034755) | 688 students from colleges around the US.

[^1]: The origins of these data are somewhat obscure: Chabris published them, crediting [Deary (2000)](https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198524175.001.0001) who in turn credits personal communication from Crawford, with no other information. Whoever Crawford is, they deserve more recognition on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)#Cognitive_ability_testing).

This is the ECAT dest, designed to measure measure aptitude for various military tasks. This was not intended to measure "intellligence" and some of the tests (like tracking and target identification) are partly physical in nature.

These subjects were tested on the 11-component revised [Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wechsler_Adult_Intelligence_Scale#WAIS-R).

[![chabris 2007 correlations](/img/g/tables/chabris2007b.svg)](/img/g/tables/chabris2007b.pdf)
The data was gathered as part of a project to test decision-making. [Raven's matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices) test shape pattern recognition, working memory is tested via [3-back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-back), and the corrdinate encoding tests check if people can tell the distance or orientation of a dot relative to a line.

[![maccann 2014 correlations](/img/g/tables/maccann2014.svg)](/img/g/tables/maccann2014.pdf)
These tests are grouped according to fluid reasoning, comprehension, quantitative knowledge, visual processing, and long-term storage/retrieval.
</details>

What do we see? It's much the same as with physical tests: Everything is correlated, but more similar stuff is more correlated.

These correlations are a bit stronger than with the physical tests, but don't take that too seriously.  All the physical tests used groups of students. With a more diverse population, correlations would probably increase. (If you add an 80-year old to a group of 20-year olds, they'll be worse at everything simultaneously.)
