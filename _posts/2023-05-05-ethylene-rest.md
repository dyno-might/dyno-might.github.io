## Introduction

While I'd like to understand the world, reality isn't structured to make that possible. Powerful big ideas are great, but inevitably you need to look at the details, and those connect to other details and it branches out forever. The chasm between this complexity and the meager capabilities of my human brain/lifespan gives me a constant feeling of dread and wonder.

To cope with this, I sometimes do random sampling---pick a *thing* and obsessively follow the links until I'm defeated.

So, umm, here's 6000 words about a plant hormone called ethylene. I got interested in this with the mundane hope of keeping my fruits and vegetables from going bad but ended up with some lessons about biology, public health, supply chains, capitalism, and ancient Greek prophecies.

## Basic science

### Ethylene is a gaseous plant hormone.

Our story is about two atoms of carbon and two atoms of hydrogen glued together as C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>.

![ethylene](/img/ethylene/ethylene-ims1.svg)

Ethylene is a colorless gas that smells sweet and musky. It acts as a hormone on plants, giving it effects on things like:

* fruit ripening
* changing colors (chlorophyll destruction)
* flower development
* root formation
* production of chemicals that defend against pathogens called [phenylpropanoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylpropanoid)
* how much ethylene plants produce

Ethylene is active at low concentrations, typically ranging from around 10 parts per billion to one part per million [(Chang 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-016-0230-0).

### Ethylene has interesting origins

[Chang (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-016-0230-0) makes the following remark:

> It is believed that plants most likely acquired the ethylene receptor gene from an ancient endosymbiotic cyanobacterium that became the chloroplast.

A biologist might yawn. For the rest of us, this sentence tells an amazing story:

1. Long ago, plant cells couldn't do photosynthesis.
2. Instead, it was done by an independent bacterium that symbiotically lived inside of plants.
3. That bacterium had an ethylene receptor gene.
4. At some point, that gene somehow managed to make its way from the bacterium into the plant genome.
5. Later on, the bacterium evolved into being the *part* of the plant cell we know as the [chloroplast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroplast).
6. Because of this independent origin, the chloroplast has its own DNA, much like [mitochondria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion) do in [animal cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote).
7. Wow dude, wow.

### Many people first rejected the idea of a gas being a hormone

You might ask: Isn't it a crazy idea to use a *gas* as a *hormone*? Well, there's an [interesting story](https://medium.com/@arif.ashraf.opu/ethylene-nobel-prize-controversy-39aebad7ee60) about that.

First, what is a hormone exactly? In 1905, [Ernest Starling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Starling) defined a hormone as a chemical that's:
1. made in small quantities in one part of a multi-cellular organism
2. has effects on a distant part of that organism

Around 1860 people noticed that gas lights led to weird (mostly bad) effects on plants. After a lot of research, 1901 Dimitry Neljubow finally identified ethylene as the active agent. But this didn't show ethylene was a hormone. For one, hormones weren't defined yet. More importantly, it wasn't known that plants *make* ethylene.

In 1910, Herbert Cousins---who only has a Wikipedia page [in German](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Henry_Cousins)---noticed that if a fungus was applied to oranges, they release a gas that causes bananas to ripen. It was only in 1934 that Richard Gane finally [showed](https://doi.org/10.1038/1341008a0) that apples synthesize ethylene.


<img src="/img/ethylene/gane.jpg" style="max-width:300px">

(Yes, the entire article is 6 paragraphs long. The times have changed, oh how they have changed.)

At first, many people rejected the idea that a gas could be a hormone, but similar experiments soon showed that many other plants also make ethylene.

Now, if ethylene is a gas, doesn't that mean it naturally drifts around, meaning plants can be manipulated by nearby plants? Well, yes. Many common fruits like apples, bananas, and avocados produce large amounts of ethylene, which has massive effects on other produce. Now, evolution doesn't explain her choices to us, so it's debatable to what degree this is "intentional", especially when it happens across species. But arguably, ethylene should be considered a [pheromone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheromone), not just a hormone.

### Humans have been manipulating ethylene for a long time

For thousands of years, people have pricked fruits (e.g. Amos' sycamores) because that causes them to produce ethylene and thus ripen. Various traditional cultures used smoke to ripen fruit, which works because smoke contains ethylene.

These days, humans manipulate ethylene on an industrial scale. We expose produce to ethylene gas and spray ethylene precursors on plants. Or when we don't *want* the effects, we scrub ethylene from the air or spray chemicals that inhibit ethylene response. We even genetically engineer plants to screw with how they produce and respond to ethylene.

Now, when humans manipulate ethylene, why are we sometimes trying to increase it and sometimes trying to decrease it? Because...

### Sometimes ethylene has good effects and sometimes bad effects.

The major *good* effects of ethylene are ripening, color development, and de-greening in citrus. There are also some obscure effects.

* It helps nuts split from their hull. This is called "dehiscence" but I implore you not to go searching for that term unless you enjoy traumatizing panoramas of human wounds.
* It can manipulate sex expression in cucumbers, melons, and pumpkins. Did you know that plants can be [trimoneocious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimonoecy), i.e. have male *and* female *and* hermaphrodite flowers? I can't figure out exactly why manipulating sex expression like this is good, but food scientists seem very excited about it.

The same effect might be good or bad, depending on the situation. Ripening fruit is good if it's immature, but not if that causes it to rot before someone eats it. Making a plant produce phenylpropanoids is good if it needs to fight off pathogens, but bad if it makes food taste bitter. Chlorophyll loss is good for oranges when it makes them look orange, but terrible for broccoli when it becomes yellow and ugly.

To answer if ethylene is good or bad for any *particular* plant, we need a bit of background.

### There are two types of fruit.

Fruits are classified as *climacteric* or *non-climacteric*. The difference is that during the final ripening stage, [climacteric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climacteric_%28botany%29) fruits have a dramatic burst of CO<sub>2</sub> and ethylene production. Here's a figure from [Paul et al. (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13197-011-0293-4):

![paul figure](/img/ethylene/paul.svg)

Here's a table of fruits:

| Type            | Examples                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Climacteric     | apple, apricot, avocado, banana, bitter melon, blueberry, cantaloupe, durian, kiwi, mango, nectarine, passion fruit, peach, pear, plum, tomato |
| Non-climacteric | berries (except blueberry), citrus, cucumber, eggplant, grape, lemon, lychee, mandarin, melon (except muskmelon), olive, peppers, pineapple, pumpkin, summer squash |

To understand what ethylene does, we need to understand two things. First, what **effects** does ethylene have? Broadly speaking, the story is:

* In climacteric fruit, ethylene will cause ripening.
* In non-climacteric fruit and vegetables, ethylene will either have bad effects or just won't do anything.

Second, how much ethylene will plants **produce**? This depends on:

* **Species**. Climacteric fruits produce a lot, non-climacteric fruits and vegetables produce much less.
* **Time**. Climacteric fruits produce much more right around when they are ripening.
* **Stresses.** Things like pathogens or wounding increase ethylene production.
* **Temperature**. Generally, plants emit less ethylene when colder. However, temporary extreme temperatures (high or low) can also sometimes act as a kind of stress and increase ethylene production.

## Kitchen practicalities

### You should be careful about what you store near what else.

Bored of all this theorizing? Just want to know where to put stuff in your kitchen?

Here's a table that classifies produce by ethylene *production* and ethylene *sensitivity*, modified from Fennema's *Food Chemistry* (Table 16.17).

|                         | Low Sensitivity                                              | Medium Sensitivity                        | High Sensitivity                                             | Effects        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| **Low Production**      | artichoke, berries, cherry, grape, pineapple, peppers, dry onions  (ð¤·ââï¸) | asparagus, bean, celery, citrus, eggplant | broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, cucumber, lettuce, persimmon, potato, spinach, strawberry (ð£) | neutral or bad |
| **Moderate Production** |                                                              | nectarine, papaya, peach, plum, tomato    | apricot, banana, mango                                       | ripens         |
| **High Production**     | (ð¤£)                                                          | avocado, cantaloupe, passion fruit        | apple, kiwi,  pear (ð)                                       | ripens         |

I kept getting confused when looking at this table, so I added emoji to try to remind myself of what the four corners are:

*  ð¤·ââï¸ --- "I don't care about ethylene"  (Low production and low sensitivity)
*  ð£ --- "Potential disaster" (Low production and high sensitivity.)
*  ð¤£ --- "Enjoy all my ethylene lol" (High production and low sensitivity.)
*  ð --- "Go go go go" (High production + high sensitivity)

Everything in the top row is a vegetable or non-climacteric fruit, while everything in the bottom two rows is a climacteric fruit. Roughly speaking, this means that for the top row, ethylene will be neutral or bad, while for the bottom two rows it will ripen stuff. (Though see the [discussion on citrus](#people-love-it-when-you-expose-citrus-to-ethylene) below).

### Home refrigerators often have high levels of ethylene.

[Wills et al. (2000)](https://doi.org/10.1071/EA99125) measured ethylene in the crisper of the refrigerators in 30 households in Australia. They found 17% had low levels (â¤ 0.015 ppm), 30% had high levels (â¥ 0.10 ppm), and the rest were in the middle. (Recall that a level like 0.1 ppm typically produces a half-maximal response.)

The most important predictor of high ethylene levels was apples. The mean level in refrigerators with apples was 0.2 ppm, compared to only 0.029 ppm in those without. 

### It's tricky to say if you should keep fruits like apples in the refrigerator.

So, apples in the refrigerator will raise ethylene levels. This is bad if you have stuff like broccoli that's ethylene sensitive. On the other hand, refrigerators lower the temperature of the apples themselves, which will decrease ethylene production. On the *other* other hand, refrigerators have little ventilation, meaning the ethylene that is produced will tend to stick around nearby. So even if all you had was apples, it isn't obvious if refrigerating them would be a net positive or a negative.

My tentative recommendation is to not refrigerate apples. They last a reasonably long time even when not refrigerated, so I don't think it's worth the risk they pose to your other produce. 

This dilemma becomes much trickier when you've got something like avocados that both produce ethylene *and* go bad quickly. There, I'm not sure what to recommend. (Just eat them faster?)

### Myth: It's bad to store onions near potatoes

Here's something you often hear:

> Onions and potatoes shouldn't be stored together because they produce a gas that will cause the other to sprout.

Often the gas isn't specified. But if it is, people point to ethylene.

I think this is a myth. At least, *if* it's bad to store them together, ethylene isn't why. Recall:

* Potatoes don't produce much ethylene but are sensitive to it.
* Onions don't produce much ethylene, and also aren't sensitive to ethylene.

What's bad is storing potatoes near ripe apples/pears/bananas/etc. 

So why do people say it's bad to store potatoes near onions? Because onions like to be stored colder than potatoes, or because they're both sensitive to humidity, or because everyone is just wrong. (See [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/7xj4xe/lpt_store_potatoes_and_onions_well_apart_from/du93w4g/) for some wonderfully obsessive research.)

### No one seems to know what ethylene concentrations are achieved inside of a paper bag

A classic grade-school science experiment is to put some fruit in a paper bag with ripe bananas and show that it ripens faster.

While this clearly works, I wanted to know: What concentration of ethylene does this create? After spending way too much time searching, I'm pretty sure no one knows the answer. The problem is that measuring ethylene concentrations in air is expensive because you need [fancy equipment](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2013.0311) that would cost a minimum of \$15k. (If you've some gas chromatography or nondispersive infrared spectroscopy equipment lying around and you want to resolve this vital question... get in touch.)

### Products for home removal of ethylene don't seem to work very well

You can buy stuff that's supposed to absorb ethylene. In theory, this should help preserve stuff longer, but in practice, they don't seem to help much.

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Debbie Meyer GreenBags<sup>â</sup> are plastic bags that are supposed to absorb ethylene. Consumer reports, as well as various local television stations, have done tests that overall found they didn't do much, and were sometimes worse than using a regular plastic bag</summary>
  [Consumer Reports](https://web.archive.org/web/20100418194904/www.consumerreports.org/cro/food/news/2008/07/debbie-meyer-green-bags/overview/storing-fruit-ov.htm) tested them on bananas, peaches, apples, melons, blackberries, strawberries, basil, asparagus, tomatoes, broccoli, grapes, lettuce, and carrots. They found that it was worse than storing in a Ziploc bag on the counter, in the refrigerator, or in plastic supermarket bags. They did find a bit of a benefit for bananas, though. 
Various local television stations have also done tests:
* KDKA found no benefit for strawberries, tomatoes, a benefit for carrots and green peppers, harm with grapes and bananas
* WPVI had one viewer test things for 30 days. They saw "a few items" did better in the GreenBags.
* [KFVS](https://web.archive.org/web/20080304103847/http://www.kfvs12.com/Global/story.asp?S=7286118) did a very weird test where they didn't check on things at all for 30 days. They mention that peppers lasted a little longer
</details>

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>The Blueapple<sup>â</sup> is an ethylene absorbing sachet that you put inside of a piece of plastic designed to feel like Science. The few tests I could find showed little benefit.</summary>
  * [KHOU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIH8k065AZs) found it seemed to help a bit for half of the vegetables.
* [KFVS](https://www.kfvs12.com/story/29661496/does-it-work-bluapple/) did a test with a control group with tomatoes, cucumbers, squash, and herbs. They found it did nothing.
* (There are lots of other websites that purport to test these, but these are inevitably littered with affiliate links *selling Bluapples* so I don't trust them at all.)
</details>

I suspect is that these products *do* absorb ethylene as claimed, but the effects just aren't big enough to rise above random variation. Also, you'd typically use these things in confined spaces which limits airflow---this could be harmful on net.

Still, I commend the idea. Some fancy refrigerators have built-in ethylene scrubbers, though I haven't been able to find any clear evidence that any specific products really help in practice.

Also, regular ultra-cheap activated carbon absorbs ethylene just fine [(Gaikwad et al. 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10311-019-00938-1), so maybe you could try to just brute-force the problem that way. (Another opportunity for someone with free time and spectroscopic sensors.)

## Industrial uses of ethylene gas

### Ethylene gas is applied to many crops post-harvest

Many climacteric fruits are picked unripe and then exposed to gaseous ethylene just before being sold. This is done because it's easier to pick and transport unripe fruit, and to reduce spoilage. It's common for avocados, bananas, mangoes, honeydew, kiwi, mango, and tomatoes [(Saltveit, 1999)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0925-5214(98)00091-X). (Sadly, I couldn't find any numbers for *how common*.)

Although half of the maximum effects of ethylene can be achieved with concentrations like 0.1 ppm, it's common to use much higher concentrations like 10 ppm or even 1000 ppm. The usual procedure is to expose the fruit at a moderate temperature of 15â25Â°C (59â77Â°F) for between 12 hours and 3 days.

### Myth: Ethylene just changes the color of tomatoes

Here's a common myth:

> Tomatoes are picked green for shipping and then exposed to ethylene gas right before being sold. This changes the color but not the flavor.

It's true that many (not all) tomatoes are picked green and then exposed to ethylene, which causes them to become red. However, this definitely does change the flavor as well as the color. (See below.)

If you don't believe this, you can test it yourself: Get some green tomatoes and put half in a bag with some ripe apples or bananas. A blind taste test will show that they are sweeter.

### Ethylene gas is part of why bananas go bad so quickly

Here's a common question:

> Bananas in the US mostly come from Central or South America. How is it that they can be harvested, washed, packaged, shipped across the ocean, and transported to a store while mildly green, yet suddenly after I take them home they go bad in a week?

Partly, this is just economics. Slower is cheaper. So, the invisible hand looked at the entire supply chain, found whatever part was cheapest to speed up, and repeated. As soon as the bananas were getting to you without rotting, it stopped.

But partly, the answer is ethylene. There's lots of natural variation in how ripe bananas will be when they arrive at the destination. Some arrive while still very green. These are exposed to ethylene gas right before being sold, which starts the ticking clock that makes them go bad within a week or two.

### People love it when you expose citrus to ethylene

Since citrus is non-climacteric, ethylene does not ripen it. Nevertheless, ethylene is often used to degrade chlorophyll and thus change the color.

Consumers *love* this. [Morales et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2019.108641 ) took two types of mandarins. They harvested some while they were still green-looking and some after higher maturity. Then they treated half of each group with ethylene and asked some people in Spain if they would buy them.

|                              | not treated | ethylene treated |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| **harvested early** (type 1) | 2%          | 53%              |
| **harvested later** (type 1) | 12%         | 82%              |
| **harvested early** (type 2) | 32%         | 72%              |
| **harvested later** (type 2) | 56%         | 70%              |

They also extracted the internal fruit (so people couldn't see the skin) and had people compare them. They couldn't find a difference.

### Myth: Oranges should be orange

Did you know that the *color* "orange" was [named after](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(colour)#Etymology) the *fruit*?

So, you'd be forgiven for thinking oranges should be orange. But no---an orange can ripen naturally on a tree and still be totally green. They only become orange when the temperature becomes lower, which causes the chlorophyll to degrade. Oranges grown near the equator---e.g. in India or Brazil---stay green even when perfectly ripe.

Nevertheless, people (in some places) *expect* citrus to be orange, so ethylene is used to "de-green" citrus. As citrus is non-climacteric theory says this should have minimal effect on the internal flesh. This has been confirmed in [oranges, grapefruit, mandarins](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2011.04.005), [clementines](https://doi.org/10.1021/jf900710v), and [suisho-buntan](https://doi.org/10.2503/jjshs.71.292) (a Japanese citrus).

## Other industrial manipulations of ethylene

### A liquid ethylene precursor is also added to many crops

It's annoying that ethylene is a gas. In particular, if you wanted to apply ethylene to plants *in the field*, that would be hard. So, people looked for liquids that would be metabolized into ethylene after being added to a plant. In 1965 they discovered [ethephon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethephon).

![ethephon](/img/ethylene/ethylene-ims2.svg)

When I first saw this, I was dumbfounded. How could ethephon be a precursor to ethylene, when it has almost no similarity? When asked about this, the Dynomight Biologist---after some prolonged giggling at the idea that I thought I could understand biochemistry by staring at pictures of molecules---explained that the central thing is the two linked carbon atoms. It's an unstable molecule, meaning the chlorine and phosphorus atoms easily get ripped off, after which hydrogen atoms get attached, and voilÃ , ethylene.

Ethephon is applied to many different plants while they are still growing, including apples, cereals, cherries, citrus, coffee, cotton, cucumbers, grapes, guava, olives, peaches, peppers, pineapple, rice, sugarcane, sweet potatoes, tobacco, tomatoes, and walnuts [(Saltveit, 1999)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0925-5214(98)00091-X). It's [approved by the EPA](https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/ppls/085678-00009-20201222.pdf) as a pesticide, though many of the applications are unrelated to pests.

How common is this? It's very situational. For walnuts, it's used in unusually hot or wet weather. For apples, it's used for some varieties in some regions.

Here's my best estimate for usage in the US.

| product                                                     | % using ethaphon |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Cotton                                                      | 60%              |
| Tomatoes                                                    | 27%              |
| Apples                                                      | 15%              |
| Tart cherries                                               | 70%              |
| Sweet cherries                                              | 10%              |
| Rasins                                                      | 5%               |
| Golf course grass (!?)                                      | <5%              |
| Peppers                                                     | <2.5%            |
| Wheat, blueberries, blackberries, cantaloupe, pears, squash | <1%              |

  Most of this information comes from [this 2016 EPA report](https://downloads.regulations.gov/EPA-HQ-OPP-2010-0098-0027/content.pdf). Some additional details:
* More that 90% of ethephon is used for cotton. In total, 7.2 million acres are treated annually using 8.1 million pounds of ethephon
* The second most important crop is tomatoes, with 49k pounds applied to an  73k acres of tomatoes annually. It looks like there are a total of around [273k acres](https://www.agmrc.org/commodities-products/vegetables/tomatoes), dedicated to tomatoes, suggesting 27% of tomatoes are treated.

* It's apparently used on turf in golf courses to slow growth and... save work mowing? Typically used in spot treatments, e.g. near tees. The [EPA](https://downloads.regulations.gov/EPA-HQ-OPP-2010-0098-0027/content.pdf) estimate less than 5% is treated by acreage.
The only other source of concrete numbers is [Watada (1986)](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.905.7978&rep=rep1&type=pdf), who states:
* Apples: Ranges from 1% to 60% depending on the region and the type of apple.
* Cherries: In the midwest, 90% of sweet cherries, and 25% of sour cherries.
* Blueberries: Only used on the last harvest of the season.
* Figs: Used on more than 50% of Calmyrna figs. (The most common type in California)
* Grapes: Used on 20% of grapes grown for raisins in California.
* Walnuts: Used with unusually hot or wet weather.
* Tomatoes: Used on 40% of tomatoes grown for processing in California.

### Great effort goes into inhibiting ethylene production

As far as the food industry is concerned, ethylene is as much foe as friend.

Imagine you're flying a plane full of babies. Initially, they're all sleeping peacefully. But if one wakes up, they'll start crying. That will eventually wake up some of the neighbors who will also start crying, and soon your plane is a very unhappy place. In this situation, you'd try very hard to keep all the babies asleep.

This is basically what it's like to move a container of bananas. If any of the bananas ripen anywhere, they will put out ethylene and start a chain reaction of ripening that will ruin the whole container.

There are several strategies to deal with this. The most obvious are refrigeration (to reduce ethylene production) and fresh air (to remove ethylene). These sound obvious but remember you have huge amounts of tightly packed fruit, and you need to prevent pockets of ethylene from forming anywhere. Also, using both refrigeration *and* fresh air at the same time will consume a lot of energy.

Another solution is to scrub ethylene out of the air. Some produce is stored and shipped using [controlled atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_atmosphere) methods, where the mixture of gases is precisely tuned to maximize longevity (typically by increasing carbon dioxide, decreasing oxygen, and removing ethylene). Some fruit is packaged along with ethylene scavenging sachets.

A third solution is to inhibit crops from producing ethylene in the first place. The most common chemical seems to be Aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), which blocks an enzyme that's upstream of ethylene. In the US it is available as [ReTain](https://www.valentbiosciences.com/cropenhancement/products/retain/) and is sprayed on fruits and vegetables preharvest to slow ripening. It's [approved](http://carovail.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ReTain-Label.pdf) for apples, pears, cherries, walnuts, pecans, apricots, peaches, and plums. In the EU, it is banned due to concerns of toxicity.

### Great effort also goes into inhibiting ethylene *response*

But maybe, on your baby plane, there's no way to prevent some of the babies from waking up. If so, then perhaps you can still prevent the sleeping babies from *hearing* the cries of those that are awake.

That is, maybe you can't keep all the ethylene out of the environment, but you can prevent your produce from *reacting* to it. 

Here again, refrigeration can help, as can increasing the amount of carbon dioxide.

A more exciting option is [1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Methylcyclopropene), marketed as [SmartFresh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SmartFresh). This is a gas that binds to the ethylene receptors, preventing ethylene from having an effect. It is approved in the EU, US, and UK for many kinds of produce including apples, tomatoes, kiwi, bananas, melons, broccoli, and potatoes. Typically people expose produce to 1-MCP for a day or so, which blocks ethylene for a few weeks.

For long-term storage, 1-MCP might be applied repeatedly. This is so effective that things like apples are sometimes preserved for as long as a full year before being sold.

I've heard tell of some other chemicals that play a similar role, including [silver thiosulfate](https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-4238(83)90001-8); [2,5-norbornadiene](https://dx.doi.org/10.1104%2Fpp.90.1.21) and [5-Diazo-1,3-cyclopentadiene](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2021.05.012).

Even more adventurous ideas are to genetically engineer produce to make it insensitive to ethylene. (Of course, this wouldn't work for climacteric fruit, which needs ethylene sensitivity in order to ripen.)

## Health

### The health risks of ethylene processing seem minimal

Is there any reason to worry about any of these chemicals? Probably not.

**Ethylene gas**.  The EPA seems [profoundly unconcerned](https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/reregistration/fs_PC-041901_1-Sep-92.pdf). This gas was actually used as an anesthetic starting in 1923 with no reports of toxicity. It's naturally occurring. But anyway, it's a gas so it's basically gone before anyone eats anything.

**Ethephon**. When ethephon is sprayed on plants, most is converted to ethylene, but some traces remain, and you eat them. It's probably not good to consume large amounts of ethephon. Animal experiments show problems for the skin, eyes, metabolism, and kidneys. There's no clear evidence regarding cancer. In the US, there are tolerances on how much ethephon can be sprayed on what types of produce at what stage of production. These are designed so that if a typical person eats produce for 70 years, they will only get [9%](https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/reregistration/fs_PC-099801_1-Apr-95.pdf) of the minimal dosage of ethephon that's believed to cause any adverse effects. It seems that non-nursing infants have a much smaller margin for error, so that might be a valid concern.

**1-MCP**. This again is a gas, meaning almost all 1-MCP will be gone before you eat anything that was treated with it. In addition, animal experiments show very [low sensitivity](https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/registration/decision_PC-224459_30-May-08.pdf) and scientists seem unconcerned about health impacts.

Some of the other chemicals (like AVG) might be more concerning, but I haven't looked into them in detail.

### Arguably ethylene processing is a big health positive.

My model of the situation is something like this:

<div style="text-align:center" markdown="1">
Ethylene processing
<br>â
<br>Produce is cheaper/tastier
<br>â
<br>People eat more produce
<br>â
<br>People are healthier
</div>
<br>

I mean, sure. You can imagine a world where society makes as produce as we have now (and as appealing as we have now) without using these chemicals. In that world, perhaps people would be healthier because they avoided consuming trace amounts of ethephon, etc. But doing this would require a much higher use of resources. In market economies, the reality is that people consider cost when choosing what to eat, and these chemicals make fruits and vegetables cheaper.

### Some of this is allowed even on organic produce

You'd think there would be some single database where you can see what's allowed and what isn't right? As far as I can tell, no---the government just expects you to read through a disorganized list of regulations each of which makes no sense unless you've read the entire chain.

Grumbling aside, here's the situation: The US National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) has a special list of synthetic (i.e. *non-organic*) chemicals that can be applied to produce which goes on to be sold as "organic". Ethephon and 1-MCP are not allowed. However, ethylene gas is approved for postharvest ripening of "tropical fruit" and degreening of citrus. It's also allowed to be used pre-harvest for pineapple flowering. It's unclear to me exactly what "tropical fruit" means here, or how common this is in practice.

## Tomatoes

### Ethylene gas is commonly used on tomatoes

There seem to be two different ways that ethylene can be applied to tomatoes:

1. Liquid ethephon can be applied to the tomato *plant* while the fruit is still attached. The purpose of this seems to be partly as a defense against pests, and partly to speed up ripening.
2. Ethylene gas can be applied to the tomato *fruit* to ripen it right before selling.

We saw above that liquid ethephon is applied to around 27% of tomato plants in the US. I have trouble finding numbers of ethylene gas, but it's pretty common. I'd guess that more than half of tomatoes have had some kind of ethylene treatment.

### Ethylene seems to have minimal effect on taste or nutrition

Be careful here. Consider four types of tomatoes:

1. Fully "table ripened" while on the plant.
2. Picked "mature green" and ripened naturally.
3. Picked "mature green" and ripened with ethylene.
4. Picked "immature green" and ripened however.

It's abundantly clear that type 1 tomatoes are the best (more nutritious and better-tasting) and type 4 tomatoes are the worst. However, there seems to be almost no difference between type 2 and type 3 tomatoes.

Much of this research is very old. It started with [Jones and Nelson](https://doi.org/10.2105/ajph.20.4.387) in 1930, while the most comprehensive paper I could find was by [Kader et al.](https://ucanr.edu/datastoreFiles/234-519.pdf) in 1978. They took tomatoes harvested at various stages, and ripened them either naturally or via ethylene. Here were the measured results:

| Picking stage          | Ripening | pH   | % soluble solids | vitamin c (mg / 100g) | sugar/acid ratio |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ---- | ---------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| Table ripe             | none     | 4.63 | 5.8              | 19.4                  | 11.9             |
| Mature green           | ethylene | 4.48 | 5.3              | 15.5                  | 10.1             |
| Mature green           | time     | 4.49 | 5.2              | 12.3                  | 10.2             |
| Partially mature green | ethylene | 4.40 | 5.1              | 15.5                  | 10.0             |
| Partially mature green | time     | 4.52 | 5.2              | 10.8                  | 10.1             |
| Immature green         | ethylene | 4.42 | 5.3              | 16.2                  | 9.5              |
| Immature green         | time     | 4.52 | 5.3              | 9.9                   | 9.9              |

They also had a panel of people rate the aroma and flavor or the tomatoes, with these results:

| Picking stage          | Ripening | Fruity-floral aroma | sweetness | sourness | off-flavor |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------------------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Table ripe             | none     | 3.1                 | 3.3       | 1.8      | 0.1        |
| Mature green           | ethylene | 2.4                 | 2.1       | 3.0      | 2.5        |
| Mature green           | time     | 2.4                 | 2.1       | 3.6      | 2.2        |
| Partially mature green | ethylene | 2.4                 | 2.4       | 3.3      | 2.7        |
| Partially mature green | time     | 2.7                 | 1.9       | 3.7      | 1.7        |
| Immature green         | ethylene | 2.4                 | 2.0       | 4.2      | 1.6        |
| Immature green         | time     | 2.6                 | 1.6       | 4.1      | 1.5        |

By basically every measure, table ripe tomatoes are best. The tomatoes that are picked earlier are worse, but it's not *ethylene* that's the problem, it's the early harvesting.

So why not just harvest tomatoes when table ripe? Well:

### Harvesting tomatoes table ripe is almost impossible

Now, not all tomatoes are harvested green. But even those that are picked red are picked less than fully ripe. Why? Because it's basically impossible. Tomatoes are very delicate, especially when fully ripe. If they were harvested that way, our current methods of picking/loading/transporting them would destroy them.

[Some tech startups](https://root-ai.com) are working on magical robots that will gently pick tomatoes as if by hand. If these worked and were deployed at scale, it would make it more cheaper to get true vine-ripened tomatoes to people. But, we'd still need to deal with packaging and shipping, and it would remain difficult to ship ripe tomatoes from Mexico to New York fast enough that they'd still be edible.

If you want really good tasting tomatoes, some options are:

1. Find hand-harvested tomatoes at local farmer's markets.
2. Buy expensive canned tomatoes that were picked ripe (either by hand or by using machinery that punctures the tomatoes).
3. Grow them yourself.

## Ethylene and the Oracle of Delphi

In ancient Greece, the oracle of Delphi operated out of the Temple of Apollo. This temple was destroyed in the name of Christianity by Roman emperor Theodosius I in AD 390, but it's a real place and the ruins still exist today.

![temple of Apollo](/img/ethylene/delphi.jpg)

The way this worked was that the high priestess (the [Pythia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia)) would bathe in the [Castalian Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castalian_Spring), sit above a chasm in the earth, go into a frenzy, and start speaking gibberish, which the priests interpreted as [opaque prophecies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oracular_statements_from_Delphi). For example, when Xerxes was approaching Greece, the Athenians went to the oracle and were famously told:

> Now your statues are standing and pouring sweat. They shiver with dread.

Four centuries later, a 23-year old Cicero asked how he could find fame, to be told:

>  Make your own nature, not the advice of others, your guide to life.

A natural question is, *why* did the Pythia go into a frenzy?

Well, did you know that Plutarch was the high priest at the temple for several years? He claimed that her powers seemed to come from vapors that came out of the spring waters that flowed under the temple.

In 2001, [De Boer et al.](https://doi.org/10.1130%2F0091-7613%282001%29029%3C0707%3ANEFTGO%3E2.0.CO%3B2) suggested that the vapor in question was... ethylene. Doctors confirmed that ethylene gas causes hallucinogenic symptoms that match Plutarch's descriptions---at low doses, people have altered speech patterns, and at high doses they thrash, groan, and stagger. Water samples taken from the Kerna spring uphill of the temple had a concentration of 0.3 ppm of ethylene.

Unfortunately, a few years later, [Foster and Lehoux](https://doi.org/10.1080/15563650601120800) poked some very large holes in this theory. The concentrations of ethylene that would come off the water are nowhere near large enough to cause hallucinations---in fact, 0.3 ppm is similar to what drivers get in typical urban traffic. You might think that ethylene from the water might accumulate, but that's unlikely since ethylene is slightly lighter than air. It's possible that the water had more ethylene in the past, but there's no evidence of this. Moreover, ethylene in the concentrations that causes trances is *extremely flammable*, and there's no historical record of any explosion or fire.

After totally ruining all the fun, their article ends with a curious attack on [positivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism)---which they define as "the belief that the empirical and logical claims of predictive science will ultimately unmask and eliminate superstition, religion and metaphysics."

> The on-going attractiveness of positivism is perhaps the reason the research of the de Boer team was so widely reported. [...] Indeed, if it was not the positivist bent of the argument that made it so widely attractive, then how did such an implausible argument get such wide press?

This seems very odd, because, isn't their paper itself an exercise in empirical and logical claims? Here's how they put it in the abstract:

> positivist dispositions can lead to the acceptance of claims because they have a scientific form, not because they are grounded in robust evidence and sound argument.

I think what they are saying is that empiricism is not *robust*. Sure, facts are great, and all. But it's easy to cherry-pick facts and find whatever conclusion you want. I guess if you only follow the branches that you like, you can convince yourself that reality is whatever you want it to be.
