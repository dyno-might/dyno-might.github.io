[No soap, radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_soap_radio) {% comment %}(via [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32250203)){% endcomment %}is a sort of prank where you tell a "joke" with a meaningless punchline. The hope is that your victim will laugh despite not understanding it, thereby enabling you to ridicule them. Apparently, this works best if you do it with an accomplice who will pretend to laugh.

Now, the obvious question is: What the hell? What kind of cruel, broken, mean-spirited people conspire to humiliate their friends like this?

But never mind. If you're *aware* that the jokes don't make any sense, [many of them](http://xenon.stanford.edu/~hays/nosoap-variations.html) genuinely *are* funny in a sort of inexplicable, dreamlike way:

> A woman goes into her bathroom and is shocked to find an elephant in her bathtub. She asks the elephant, "What are you doing in my bathtub?" The elephant responds, "No soap, radio!"

> Two polar bears are sitting in a bathtub. The first one says, "Pass the soap." The second one says, "No soap, radio!"

I wondered: Does this format have unrealized potential? Are there any funny variants without bathtubs or talking animals? How far does it go?

To probe the limits of the genre, I created a corpus of candidate No Soap Radios and then filtered for those at least one test subject thought were funny. Empirically, no jokes had universal approval and some people didn't like *any* or even really see what was being attempted. (If you didn't like the above elephant, you should probably turn back now.)

After all this, my thesis is that No Soap Radio is an overlooked and potent technology to explore the boundary between anti-humor and *anti*-anti-humor, if that's a thing.

> Struggling at the end of the semester, a friend offers Claire some NeuroHoist-48. After taking it, her mind kicks up a gear and she realizes she can use a single project for both her Epistemology and Natural Language Processing classes. The Trilemma Dialect Annihilator will ingest the archives of *Synthese* and build a deep conflict-resolving knowledge embedding.

> She just finishes before the class demo, with no time to test it. Her professor queries it with:
> > `Why are we involuntarily flung into life with no instructions and no obvious purpose? Is there no meaning, or are humans just too simple to understand it?`
>
> The Annihilator immediately replies:
> > `True meaning is within your grasp, but a city cannot be built in a cave and truths cannot be built on a recursive foundation of other truths.`
>
> Everyone is flummoxed except Claire who furiously scribbles equations. After a minute she gasps and starts weeping with joy. After everyone begs her to explain, she says, "No soap, radio!"

Not so funny, right? Maybe even a little bit painful? I think this is the most natural evolution of the format.

> Radio and Soap are barnacles living above a volcano in the Pacific. They are debating if Americans understand synthwave music. Soap is saying--- "*they view Future Club as failing at irony, whereas Europeans see it as succeeding both non-ironically and doubly*"---when the volcano erupts, throwing them into the sky.

> Struggling to be heard amongst the fragments of rock and magma, Radio yells, "*THAT'S BECAUSE DESPITE THE 80s ICONOGRAPHY, SYNTHWAVE HAS TO BE SEEN FROM THE VANTAGE OF LATE 90s FRENCH NU-DISCO WHERE THE AESTHETIC*..."

>
> "*NO, NO, DON'T WORRY*," Radio reassures him, "No soap, radio."

So, uh, maybe not so much unrealized potential?
