Say you want to learn about sleep. You see two articles:

1. "Theory and practice of effective sleep"

2. "Seven insights about sleep"

Are you drawn to the second? I am. Of course, I hate myself for this because I've internalized the idea that lists are cheap and low-class. But I'm drawn to lists all the same.

Arguably, list-hating is "correct" today in that most list-based articles are bad. But we're in a weird game-theoretic equilibrium. SEO spammers long ago noticed that people liked lists, so they covered the web in list-puke. We're now in a reactionary phase where "serious" people avoid the format.

But why do we like lists in the first place?

I claim we like them because they are an objectively good way to organize information. They allow readers to quickly and easily get what they want. In fact, if you're unsure how to structure something you're writing, a list should probably be your default choice.
