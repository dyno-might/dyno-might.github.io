Hello, clever charming good-looking people. I am in need of a richer understanding of:

* you
* the nature of reality
* consciousness
* ethics
* dynomight internet website
  
and have therefore created a survey, which you can take [here](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/hCgvh68rsRdF4jHmo8Goj9j-+Z4-TevRyFMzrQ88hcw/). (You don't need to create an account or give your email or any such nonsense.)

If you'd like to see what you'd be getting into, I include some questions below. But you can't actually take the survey here, you need to follow [this link](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/hCgvh68rsRdF4jHmo8Goj9j-+Z4-TevRyFMzrQ88hcw/) to do that.

## ABOUT YOU

Were you born in the first half or second half of your birth year?
* First half (Jan / Feb / Mar / Apr / May / Jun)
* Second half (Jul / Aug / Sep / Oct / Nov / Dec)

Say there's a pill that makes you immune to food. (You never feel hungry. You CAN eat if necessary, and it's not painful, but it's not enjoyable, so you wouldn't bother unless there was a good reason. There are no side effects, and your health/lifespan stay the same as now.) How much would you pay for this pill?

* $0 (I don't want the pill)
* $10
* $100
* $1,000
* $10,000
* $100,000
* $1,000,000
* $10,000,000 or more

Say there's a pill that would eliminate your need to pee or defecate. (You never need to do these, but otherwise everything is just like it is now.) How much would you pay for this pill?

* $0 (I don't want the pill)
* $10
* $100
* $1,000
* $10,000
* $100,000
* $1,000,000
* $10,000,000 or more

Say there's a pill that would make you immune to sleep. (You never need to do it, but your average energy level is the same as it is now. Your lifespan is unaffected.) How much would you pay for this pill?

* $0 (I don't want the pill)
* $10
* $100
* $1,000
* $10,000
* $100,000
* $1,000,000
* $10,000,000 or more

## ABOUT THE NATURE OF REALITY 

Suppose that 1 out of a million people can live to be 5000 years old. (It's known at birth but random and non-genetic. They age normally until 18, then start aging at ~1.3% the normal rate.) How much would the existence of these people change society?

* society would be unrecognizable
* a lot
* a fair amount
* a little
* not much at all

* P < 20%
* 20 ≤ P < 40%
* 40 ≤ P < 60%
* 60 ≤ P < 80%
* 80 ≤ P ≤ 100%

## ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS

In the following questions, you will be asked how much you agree with a bunch of different theories of consciousness. (Reminder: If you don't like these questions, you can skip ahead.)

Neutral monist property dualism: There's a deeper layer of reality where everything is unified, physical and mental properties are just glimpses.

## ABOUT ETHICS

In the correct version of utilitarianism, how should you make choices that change the number of agents?

* Maximize the SUM of utility of all agents (so trillions of semi-happy people is better than millions of insanely happy people)
* Maximize the MEAN utility of all agents (so one very happy person is better than trillions of medium-happy people)
* Maximize something between the sum and the mean.
* Utilitarianism should only be used in situations where the set of agents is fixed and these distinctions don't matter.
* I disagree with utilitarianism so much that I refuse to answer this question.

If you combine utilitarianism and game theory, thinking about repeated interactions, how your decisions interact with other people's decisions, etc., how similar does utilitarianism look to VIRTUE ETHICS?

* Very
* Kinda
* A little
* Not at all

If you combine utilitarianism and game theory, thinking about repeated interactions, how your decisions interact with other people's decisions, etc., how similar does utilitarianism look to DEONTOLOGY?

* Very
* Kinda
* A little
* Not at all

If you combine utilitarianism and game theory, thinking about repeated interactions, how your decisions interact with other people's decisions, etc., how similar does utilitarianism look to COMMONSENSE MORALITY?

* Very
* Kinda
* A little
* Not at all

## ABOUT DYNOMIGHT

Should dynomight be:

* more weird
* equally weird
* less weird

![benedict cumberbatch](/img/survey/bc5.jpg)

Did you think that (the above image) was funny?

* Yes
* A little
* No
* Huh?

How would you feel if I took posts from >2 years ago that I wanted to heavily revise and sent out a new "edition"? (Bearing in mind that I won't realistically be motivated enough to actually do the revising if it's just to update an old post and no one will read the update.)

* I'd feel great.
* I'd feel good.
* I wouldn't care.
* I'd be slightly annoyed.
* I'd be very annoyed.

Sometimes I write things that are insanely long. When that happens should I:

* Break it up into pieces assuming they can be read semi-independently.
* Just publish the whole monstrosity.
* Whatever.

Do you want to give me money? Say I abandoned my trusty *money bad* posture and made it possible for you to give me money but I also said something like:

> _GIVING ME MONEY IS TOTALLY OPTIONAL AND IF YOU WANT TO SUPPORT ME AND YOU'RE TORN BETWEEN GIVING ME MONEY OR OCCASIONALLY FORWARDING A POST TO FRIEND I'D HONESTLY PREFER YOU DID THE LATTER_

and also say I didn't paywall any posts, but in order to make it emotionally easier to give me money if you already wanted to give me money say I added some "odds and ends" to the ends of posts for money-givers, and also say that in the short term I'd likely use the money to hire an editor but hypothetically if I someday became like 100× more popular I might reduce the number of hours I work and spend more time blogging.

In the above hypothetical, would you give me money? (Please err on the side of saying no.)

* No (it's ok!)
* Maybe
* Probably
* Absolutely

If you subscribe via substack, does it annoy you that substack has all sorts of invasive tracking on the website and emails etc.?

* I don't subscribe via substack but not because of this.
* I don't subscribe via substack partially because of this.
* I do subscribe via substack but don't care about this.
* I do subscribe via substack and am annoyed by this.

If you subscribe via RSS/Atom, do you ever experience any of the following technical problems?

* I don't subscribe by RSS but I want to be a part of this question.
* Images not showing up
* Images rendering badly
* Tables rendering badly
* Expandy-boxes not working
* Posts not showing up
* Posts showing up repeatedly
* I experience some other problem

Do you wish that dynomight.net had some kind of forum/comments? Some people have asked for this, but these days I figure most people prefer to comment elsewhere anyway? (Please err on the side of saying "no" because creating this would be kind of annoying.)

* No
* Whatever
* Yes
* Yes, please, I beg you

Which of the following types of posts do you wish there were MORE of?

* "Advanced lists" (reasons to be thankful, things that don't work)
* Health (seed oils, colonoscopies, air quality)
* Book reports (Bourdieu, Reasons and Persons)
* Politics-y (Assange/espionage, harvard, abortion, death penalty, homelessness)
* Random obsessions (ethylene, nuclear weapons)
* Psychology (MBTI, factors of intelligence, gratitude)
* Shorts

Which of the following types of posts do you wish there were LESS of?

* "Advanced lists" (reasons to be thankful, things that don't work)

Any additional wisdom (about anything except seed oils)?
