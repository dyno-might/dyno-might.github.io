## Ethylene gas is commonly used on tomatoes

There seem to be two different ways that ethylene can be applied to tomatoes:

1. Liquid ethephon can be applied to the tomato *plant* while the fruit is still attached. The purpose of this seems to be partly as a defense against pests, and partly to speed up ripening.
2. Ethylene gas can be applied to the tomato *fruit* to ripen it right before selling.

We saw above that liquid ethephon is applied to around 27% of tomato plants in the US. I have trouble finding numbers of ethylene gas, but it's pretty common. I'd guess that more than half of tomatoes have had some kind of ethylene treatment.

## Ethylene seems to have minimal effect on taste or nutrition

Be careful here. Consider four types of tomatoes:

1. Fully "table ripened" while on the plant.
2. Picked "mature green" and ripened naturally.
3. Picked "mature green" and ripened with ethylene.
4. Picked "immature green" and ripened however.

It's abundantly clear that type 1 tomatoes are the best (more nutritious and better-tasting) and type 4 tomatoes are the worst. However, there seems to be almost no difference between type 2 and type 3 tomatoes.

Much of this research is very old. It started with [Jones and Nelson](https://doi.org/10.2105/ajph.20.4.387) in 1930, while the most comprehensive paper I could find was by [Kader et al.](https://ucanr.edu/datastoreFiles/234-519.pdf) in 1978. They took tomatoes harvested at various stages, and ripened them either naturally or via ethylene. Here were the measured results:

| Picking stage          | Ripening | pH   | % soluble solids | vitamin c (mg / 100g) | sugar/acid ratio |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ---- | ---------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| Table ripe             | none     | 4.63 | 5.8              | 19.4                  | 11.9             |
| Mature green           | ethylene | 4.48 | 5.3              | 15.5                  | 10.1             |
| Mature green           | time     | 4.49 | 5.2              | 12.3                  | 10.2             |
| Partially mature green | ethylene | 4.40 | 5.1              | 15.5                  | 10.0             |
| Partially mature green | time     | 4.52 | 5.2              | 10.8                  | 10.1             |
| Immature green         | ethylene | 4.42 | 5.3              | 16.2                  | 9.5              |
| Immature green         | time     | 4.52 | 5.3              | 9.9                   | 9.9              |

They also had a panel of people rate the aroma and flavor or the tomatoes, with these results:

| Picking stage          | Ripening | Fruity-floral aroma | sweetness | sourness | off-flavor |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------------------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Table ripe             | none     | 3.1                 | 3.3       | 1.8      | 0.1        |
| Mature green           | ethylene | 2.4                 | 2.1       | 3.0      | 2.5        |
| Mature green           | time     | 2.4                 | 2.1       | 3.6      | 2.2        |
| Partially mature green | ethylene | 2.4                 | 2.4       | 3.3      | 2.7        |
| Partially mature green | time     | 2.7                 | 1.9       | 3.7      | 1.7        |
| Immature green         | ethylene | 2.4                 | 2.0       | 4.2      | 1.6        |
| Immature green         | time     | 2.6                 | 1.6       | 4.1      | 1.5        |

By basically every measure, table ripe tomatoes are best. The tomatoes that are picked earlier are worse, but it's not *ethylene* that's the problem, it's the early harvesting.

So why not just harvest tomatoes when table ripe? Well:

## Harvesting tomatoes table ripe is almost impossible

Now, not all tomatoes are harvested green. But even those that are picked red are picked less than fully ripe. Why? Because it's basically impossible. Tomatoes are very delicate, especially when fully ripe. If they were harvested that way, our current methods of picking/loading/transporting them would destroy them.

[Some tech startups](https://root-ai.com) are working on magical robots that will gently pick tomatoes as if by hand. If these worked and were deployed at scale, it would make it more cheaper to get true vine-ripened tomatoes to people. But, we'd still need to deal with packaging and shipping, and it would remain difficult to ship ripe tomatoes from Mexico to New York fast enough that they'd still be edible.

If you want really good tasting tomatoes, some options are:

1. Find hand-harvested tomatoes at local farmer's markets.
2. Buy expensive canned tomatoes that were picked ripe (either by hand or by using machinery that punctures the tomatoes).
3. Grow them yourself.
