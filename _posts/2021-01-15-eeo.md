If you ever joined a large organization in the US, you filled out an ethnicity form. Here's a typical one:

> **VOLUNTARY SELF IDENTIFICATION FORM**
>
> Please check one of the following: 
>
> ☐ **American Indian or Alaska Native** \
> ☐ **Asian** \
> ☐ **Black or African American** \
> ☐ **Hispanic or Latino** \
> ☐ **Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander** \
> ☐ **White** \
> ☐ **Two or More Races**
>
> The employer is subject to certain governmental recordkeeping and reporting requirements for the administration of civil rights laws and regulations. In order to comply with these laws, the employer invites employees to voluntarily self-identify their race or ethnicity. Submission of this information is voluntary and refusal to provide it will not subject you to any adverse treatment. The information obtained will be kept confidential and may only be used in accordance with the provisions of applicable laws, executive orders, and regulations, including those that require the information to be summarized and reported to the federal government for civil rights enforcement. When reported, data will not identify any specific individual.

One thing's clear: This is *voluntary*. But some places add something like this:

> If you choose not to self-identify, your gender and ethnicity will be recorded by a representative based on visual observation.

Rather changes the vibe, no? What's going on here?

The Civil Right Act was passed in 1964 and amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act in 1973. They bring us [Title 29, Volume 4, Section 1619.601 of the federal code](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2007-title29-vol4/xml/CFR-2007-title29-vol4-sec1614-601.xml). This says:

1. Employers must ask your ethnicity.
2. If you refuse to answer, they must explain that they *have* to collect the information.
3. If you still refuse, they must guess based on your looks.
4. If they are forced to guess, they must tell you what they've guessed.
5. If you give an obvious lie, they must ask you to be serious.
6. If you insist on lying, they must to record it anyway.
7. They must keep the ethnicity data separate from other personnel records.
8. The government asks whatever it wants whenever it wants. The employer must answer.

What happens in practice? Here's the experience of everyone I know:

* You're given a form.
* Whatever you answer (or don't) you never hear anything again.

I'm sure that *someone*, *somewhere* has done steps 2, 4, and 5 above, but I've not heard of it. Outside of the federal code itself, I've never seen a reference to these steps, not even by the [US Equal Employment Opportunity Consort](https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo-1-survey/fact-sheet-eeo-1-survey-filers) (EEOC) who run the program.

Some places do explain what happens if you don't disclose. If you get a job at the FDIC, [their form](http://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf181.pdf) says:

> In the instance of missing information, your employing agency will attempt to identify your race and ethnicity by visual observation.

Clear language, at the top of the form. Good for you, FDIC!

How many places explain this? To get a rough estimate, I searched for "EEO disclosure form" and filtered for forms that seem to actually be used. I then checked if they explain what happens if you refuse to fill out the form.

Why do so many places not explain this? They have nothing to be ashamed of, and everywhere does it.

Well, remember text at the start of the post? That's [the EEOC's suggested language](https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo-1-survey/eeo-1-instruction-booklet). Most places use it nearly unchanged. 

*Why* is the EEOC's suggested language so misleading? I don't know.

So, where are we?

* You're asked about your ethnicity because organizations *must* report it to the government. It's not optional, the categories are fixed, and there's no "unknown" option. 

* Many places emphasize that *you have the right not to answer*. That's true but misleading since if you don't answer they have to guess.

* They probably don't intent to mislead– they're just using the the EEOC's suggested language. Why is the EEOC's language is unclear, we don't know.

* Unlike your hollow right to not answer, you right to *lie* about your ethnicity is absolute.

* This odd constellation of rights is eerily plausible as a woke platform now, half a century later after they were created. This was surely not foreseeable at the time.

* There's a bunch of related rules that no one knows exist. That might be good– this is all awkward enough already.
