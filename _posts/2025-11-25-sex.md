You know the story: Life reproduces and evolves. Random mutations happen and the good ones tend to stick around. Fine. But why reproduce *sexually*? Why mix the genes of two parents? Life goes to *quite* some length to make this happen, so there must be some advantage. What is it?

Darwin was baffled by this question. He said the issue was "hidden in darkness".

Let's clarify the mystery: Say you're a female. The goal of reproduction is to copy your genes, right? You could have evolved to make a baby that's a little clone of yourself. But you don't—you take someone *else's* genes and then copy half of theirs in rather than your own. Why would you do that?

Of course, lots of animals that reproduce asexually including various insects, fish, snakes, lizards, and sharks. But it's very rare for complex animals to reproduce *exclusively* asexually. The classic example has long been [bdelloid rotifers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bdelloidea), these tiny worm-like organisms:

![bdelloid rotifers](/img/sex/bdelloid.jpg)

These delicious things may live in your tap water. Biologists have long been amazed that they have thrived for tens of millions of years with only asexual reproduction. But recent evidence now suggests that even these have some mechanisms to swap genes ([Flot et al. 2013](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12326), [Vakhrusheva et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19614-y)).

Why? Aren't genes supposed to be selfish?

Let’s start from first principles. Let's build a simple model of reproduction and see if we can get some insight.

## Modeling choices

The simpler we can make our model, the better. It is not a goal to capture the full complexity of evolution in the real world. Just the opposite! We want to *remove* as much complexity as possible—that way it will be easiest to isolate the difference that sexual reproduction makes.

Our model will need a few objects. We will need a few things:

* Some group of *organisms*.
* With some set of *genes*.
* That somehow *reproduce*.
* With probabilities that *depend* somehow on the genes.

Let's talk about these in order.

**Organisms.** Let's take a single species, with no "males" or "females". Let's take a fixed population size, and assume that life takes place in discrete generations: Everyone in a generation is born at the same time, and then dies and reproduces at the same time at the end.

**Genes.** Let's represent each individual's genes as a fixed-length string. So all the different "letters"' at location 29 in the string correspond to all the different possible genes. But how many letters/genes should there be at each location? In the real world, genes can have a terrifying array of functions. But all that we care about is the final impact on how likely everyone is to reproduce. We don't want to explicitly model all the different possible genes, but we must reflect that if you mutate someone's DNA in a random way, it will usually be harmful.

A simple way that you might model this would be to have, say, 100 possible genes at each location, where 1 of them is "good" and the rest are "bad", and that during mutations a new one is chosen at random. Then if any gene mutated, it would have a 1% chance of getting the good version, and a 99% chance of getting a bad version.

But if we did that, there would be no need to keep track of *which* particular bad gene each person has. So instead, we will just say that each gene can either be bad (`0`) or good (`1`). During mutations, good genes are much more likely to become bad than the reverse.

**Reproduction.** We'll have two slightly different models of reproduction. In *asexual reproduction*, a parent is chosen for each child, then the parent's genes are copied. (We'll discuss how the parents are chosen below.) In *sexual reproduction* a parent gets two children and each gene is randomly copied from one of the two children. (Technically this means our species is "haploid"—there's just one gene at each location. This is different from "diploid" species like humans where you have two genes at each location, one from each parent.) In either case, after genes are copied over from the parent or parents, each gene has a small probability to mutate.

**Parental probabilities.** Someone, individuals with more good genes should have a higher chance of being parents. One naive choice might be to say that someone's chance of being a parent increases linearly in the number of good genes—someone with twice as many good genes has around twice the chance of being a parent. But I don't think this is realistic—in reality, if someone with 10 good genes is competing with someone with 40, their odds of reproducing are much less than 25%.

Instead, let's model the odds *multiplicatively*. Each individual has a "fitness", which starts out at 1, and then increases by 10% (compounding) for each good gene. Then, when each new child is being born with asexual reproduction, they randomly choose a parent with probabilities proportional to the fitness in the previous generation. For sexual reproduction, they choose *two* parents in the same way. Note that all parents are chosen independently: Any two people can be parents for any child. The same individual can even be a parent with *themselves*.


## Asexual model

Putting the pieces together, here's our simple model of asexual reproduction:

1. There are <var>N</var> people. Each person has <var>G</var> genes, each either good or bad.
2. Each person has a fitness. It starts at one and increases by 10% for each good gene.  
3. At the end of each generation, everyone dies and <var>N</var> children people are born.
4. Each child has a single parent from the previous generation, chosen with probability proportional to fitness.  
5. The child's genes are first copied from the parent, then mutated. Each good gene has a 2% change to become bad, while each bad gene has a 0.1% chance to become good.


That's it. That's the whole model. Of course, you can change the three magical numbers (10%, 2%, 0.1%) if you want—the only important detail is that bad mutations are more common than good ones.

To understand this, let's simulate a single generation. Say there are <var>N=5</var> people and <var>G=4</var> genes, and this is the population:

| Person | Genes  | Fitness | Parent prob |
| ------ | ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| 1      | `0000` | 1       | .170        |
| 2      | `1000` | 1.1     | .187        |
| 3      | `0100` | 1.1     | .187        |
| 4      | `0011` | 1.21    | .206        |
| 5      | `1111` | 1.461   | .249        |

The first person has all bad (`0`) genes, so their fitness is 1, while the last person has four good (`1`) genes, so their fitness is 1.1⁴ = 1.461. The probability of being a parent is each person's fitness divided by the total population fitness of 1+1.1+1.1+1.21+1.461 = 5.871.

So let's create the next generation. First, each child gets a parent chosen according to the parent probabilities, so people with more good genes are more likely to reproduce. After copying genes over from the parents, each good gene has a 2% chance to mutate and become bad, while each bad gene has a 0.1% chance to mutate and become good. In this case, there is just a single (bad) mutation.

| Child | Parent | Copied | Mutated      |
| ----- | ------ | ------ | ------------ |
| 1     | 2      | `1000` | `1000`       |
| 2     | 5      | `1111` | `1111`       |
| 3     | 2      | `1000` | `1000`       |
| 4     | 5      | `1111` | `111`**`0`** |
| 5     | 3      | `0100` | `0100`       |

Note there are two competing dynamics. People with more good genes have more children. This tends to increase the number of good genes. However, bad mutations are more common than good ones, which decreases the number of good genes.

In the above example, there was just one bad mutation and no good ones. Even so, the total number of good genes in the population increased from 8 in the parent generation to 10 in the children.

## Asexual evolution

So let's run this thing! Here's a simulation with N=100 people and G=100 genes, starting with all bad genes. In each iteration, we show a big array with a white square for a bad gene and a blue square for a good one. To make things look more stable, I insert the children based on the location of their parents. The second plot shows a histogram of how many people have a given number of good genes.

<script>
syncVideos('asexual-small','asexual-small-array');

We can summarize the full trace of evolution with a single plot, where the line shows the mean number of good genes and the colored region shows the standard deviation.

![time-asexual-only](/img/sex/time-asexual-small.svg)

## Parents

As an aside, we can plot the entire history of descendants in a giant crazy-looking tree:

![asexual_parents](/img/sex/asexual-small-parents.svg)

To show ancestry over time, each person in the original population gets a different color, which is inherited by all descendants. As you can see, eventually one person from the original population ends up the the ancestor of *everyone*. When that happens, everyone gets a new random color and the process repeats. That's asexual reproduction for you: Either you disappear or you take over the universe.

## More asexual evolution

That was fun. But it's even more fun with a larger population. So let's do it again, this time with <var>N</var>=500 people, and running for more generations.

<div>
<video id="asexual-array" autoplay muted loop>
  <source src="/img/sex/anim-asexual-array.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="/img/sex/anim-asexual-array.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</video>
<img src="/img/sex/time-asexual-only.svg" alt="time-asexual-only">
</div>

<script>
syncVideos('asexual','asexual-array');
</script>

It is possible to plot the descendent tree with 500 people, and the resulting is very cool looking. But it is also very-extremely-very large and might cause technical problems, so click [here](/img/sex/asexual-parents.pdf) at your peril.

Anyway, notice something: With a population of 100 people, things stabilized with people having around 20 good genes. Now, with a population of 500, that's increased to around 30. Why?

It's useful to think about the limiting cases: If you had just a *single* person, evolution would be entirely driven by mutations, with no positive selection pressure. Since the vast majority of mutations are bad, there would be almost no good genes.

If you had an *infinite* population, then in the first generation there would be some extremely lucky children who happened to get the right mutations to have *all* good genes. They'd have very high fitness and so would produce lots of children with good genes.

The challenge for evolution is *genetic load*. Selection pressure is always trying to increase the number of good genes. But the more good genes there are, the more opportunities there are for bad mutations to happen. Eventually these two dynamics reach and equilibrium and things stabilize. But with a larger population, you have more chances for people to "get lucky" and avoid the bad mutations, so things stabilize at a higher level.

## Sexual model

Now, what about *sexual* reproduction? Our model is almost the same, just with two changes, highlighted below.

1. There are N *people*. Each person has G *genes*, each of which is either *good* or *bad*.
2. Each person has a *fitness* which starts are one and increases by 10% for each good gene.
3. There are discrete generations. At the end of each generation, everyone dies and N new people are born.
4. Each child has **two parents** from the previous generation, chosen with probability proportional to fitness.
5. **Each of the child's genes is randomly copied from the same location in one of the two parents**, then mutated. Each good gene has a 2% change to become bad, while each bad gene has a 0.1% chance to become good.

Again, it's helpful to run a single generation by hand. We'll start with the same population we used with asexual reproduction.

| Person | Genes  | Fitness | Parent Prob |
| ------ | ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| 1      | `0000` | 1       | .170        |
| 2      | `1000` | 1.1     | .187        |
| 3      | `0100` | 1.1     | .187        |
| 4      | `0011` | 1.21    | .206        |
| 5      | `1111` | 1.461   | .249        |

To create the next generation, each person gets two parents, chosen according to the parent probabilities. Each gene is copied randomly from one of the two parents and then mutated.

| Child | Parent A | Parent B | Choices | Copied | Mutated |
| ----- | -------- | -------- | ------- | ------ | ------- |
| 1     | 2        | 4        | `ABAA`  | `1000` | `1000`  |
| 2     | 5        | 5        | `BAAA`  | `1111` | `1101`  |
| 3     | 2        | 3        | `BBBA`  | `0100` | `0100`  |
| 4     | 5        | 2        | `AAAA`  | `1111` | `1111`  |
| 5     | 3        | 2        | `ABBA`  | `0000` | `0000`  |

Remember, there are no "males" or "females" in this model—anyone can breed with anyone, including themselves.

## Sexual evolution

So let's run this thing! This time, let's jump straight to the larger simulation with <var>N</var>=500 people and <var>G</var>=100 genes. We start with all bad genes (white) and evolve towards good genes (red).

<video id="sexual-array" autoplay muted loop>
  <source src="/img/sex/anim-sexual-array.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="/img/sex/anim-sexual-array.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<video id="sexual" autoplay muted loop>
  <source src="/img/sex/anim-sexual.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="/img/sex/anim-sexual.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<script>
syncVideos('sexual','sexual-array');
</script>

It looks like we end up with a lot more good genes. If we compare the trace to that with asexual evolution, the difference is stark:

![time-both](/img/sex/time-both.svg)

This isn't an artifact of how we started the simulation. We can run the same experiment starting with all good genes, rather than bad. Now, bad mutations cause the populations to get worse over time, but sexual selection is much better able to resist, and things stabilize at a similar place to the first simulation.

![time-start1](/img/sex/time-start1.svg)

Of, if you like, you can start the simulation with half good genes. Now things take off in different directions right from the beggning.

![time-start1](/img/sex/time-startp5.svg)

Sexual reproduction is better. It's a *lot* better, and it's very robust.

## But why?

So we invented simple models of reproduction, ran them, and observed that sexual reproduction works much better.

This tells us a lot, precisely *because* our models are so simple. Our models only have competition, genes, mutations, and reproduction. They have no notion of physical space, inter-species competition, biological sex, resource constraints, chromosomes, signaling, Malthusian competition or Mendelian inheritance. So we don't need any of these things to explain the advantage of sexual reproduction.

OK, but still, why *why does sexual reproduction work better*? I'll try to answer that question in the next post.
