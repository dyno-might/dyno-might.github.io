Kill your ultrasonic humidifier. This was my #1 recommendation after spending weeks reading about [air quality](/air) and health. The common reaction to this seemed to be somewhere between "*...the hell?*" and "*I'll never trust you again.*''

I hear you. Humidifiers seem so wholesome and innocent. I know it *seems* ridiculous, and I don't want to believe it either. But the case against ultrasonic humidifiers is very simple:

* They create huge numbers of tiny airborne particles.
* Airborne particles typically cause massive health problems.
* While it's uncertain if the *particular* particles from ultrasonic humidifiers are harmful, the risk is *insane* compared to the benefit.

The current science says there's a serious chance that using an ultrasonic humidifier could cut years from your life. The solution is easy: Use an evaporative or steam humidifier instead.



## Ultrasonic humidifiers create tons of particles

> Ultrasonic humidifiers [...] create tiny droplets consisting of water and its impurities. Once the water evaporates, the impurities can remain suspended as airborne particles. One of the primary concerns for household humidifiers is their ability to aerosolize pathogenic microbes. [...] This white dust was associated with respiratory distress in children if inhaled

>  Ultrasonic humidifiers were found to have a substantial impact on home indoor concentrations and personal exposures for SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> as well as PM<sub>2.5</sub> , likely as the result of aerosolization of sulfates and other dissolved minerals present in the water. For the two subjects with ultrasonic humidifiers, personal SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and PM exposures were approximately two and five times greater, respectively, than corresponding ambient concentrations.

> When inhaled during an 8-hr exposure time, and depending on mineral water quality, humidifier aerosols can deposit up to 100 s of μg minerals in the human child respiratory tract and 3–4.5 times more μg of minerals in human adult respiratory tract. [...] Distilled water should be used whenever possible to prevent respiratory irritation (USEPA, 1991), although there is little indication that consumers are aware of or follow this consideration.

> The ultrasonic humidifier has converted all the non-volatile solutes in tap water into PM. [...]  notice an unexpectedly high concentration of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>  in PM [...] We have detected a compound with a mass-to-charge ratio equivalent to that of azelaic acid or structure isomers. This result demonstrates the possibility that organic compounds can be associated with humidifier PM. [...] Operating a single ultrasonic humidifier with tap water resulted in PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations up to hundreds of  μg/m³.

> The concentrations of metals/elements varies based on particle size and particle water content. Nonetheless, the same relative amounts of metals/elements are present in each particle. Thus, inhalation of small particles increased mass exposure to common tap water metals (e.g., calcium, sodium, magnesium), and also associated anions.

Still not convinced? You can read [Wang et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106654) or [Fleisch et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41370-019-0151-4) or [Baxter et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.jes.7500532) or [Umezawa et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-8977-10-64) or [Highsmith et al., 1988](https://doi.org/10.1021/es00174a019) or [Richard Saint Cyr](https://www.myhealthbeijing.com/pollution/ultrasonic-humidifiers-in-beijing-an-unnecessary-risk/) or [Stack Exchange](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/105154/why-does-humidifier-put-measurable-pm2-5-in-the-air) or [Awair](https://blog.getawair.com/awair-investigates-how-your-humidifiers-water-affects-your-health). It isn't controversial. This is a thing that happens.



# Particles cause serious health problems

The evidence for this is [strong](https://dynomight.net/fix-your-air/). The basic story is that outdoor particle levels vary throughout the world and  statistics link these levels to many health problems, including heart disease, strokes, kidney disease, respiratory infections, and lung cancer. The mechanism appears to be that tiny particles make their way through the lungs into the bloodstream and thus other parts of the body. These foreign particles then activate the immune system causing all sorts of havoc.

A good [heuristic](https://dynomight.net/air/#a-heuristic-to-quantify-harms) is that an increase of 33.3 PM<sub>2.5</sub> μg/m³ costs around 1 disability adjusted life year. The most polluted cities in the world have levels around 100 PM<sub>2.5</sub> μg/m³. Ultrasonic humidifiers can easily push levels to several **hundred** μg/m³. If you used one for 8 hours a night and it created a level of 300 μg/m³, this would raise your average exposure by 100 μg/m³, meaning an expected cost of 3 disability adjusted life years.

# The risk-reward ratio is insane

These calculations are uncertain. Our estimates for the harms particles cause are based on observational statistics, not randomized trials. Also, different types of particles surely cause amounts of trouble, and we don't know how harmful the kind humidifiers make are.

From a risk management perspective, this doesn't matter. For one thing, there's uncertainty in both directions. Sure, maybe the harms are less than we estimate, but they could also be *even worse*.

There's a much deeper reason this uncertainty doesn't matter, though. Three years is simply an *insane* risk to take. Say that for some reason, you're 75% sure I'm wrong and that ultrasonic humidifiers are harmless. Then I ask you: Is the benefit of your ultrasonic humidifier worth taking that risk? In expectation the cost is now 9 months instead of 3 years. Is that worth it?

Now, maybe you *really* hate dry air. You might decide that it's worth risking 3 years of life to be comfortable. I think that's unwise, but it doesn't matter. You don't need to make that choice!

You aren't choosing between risking 3 years of life and having dry air. You are choosing between risking three years of life and *getting a different kind of humidifier*. Buy a steam humidifier or an evaporative humidifier. It will cost $20-100, and it will humidify the air just as well. There's no plausible calculation that it's worth risking even a small fraction of 3 years to save that amount of money.

The reason people don't want to kill their ultrasonic humidifier is because they're operating from the perspective that *they will be considered safe until there is irrefutable proof they aren't*. That's incredibly misguided. When there's a possibility of an extremely large harm, it's wiser to *assume the danger is real until there's proof it's safe*.

Evaporative and steam humidifiers seem to create almost no particles. (See [Park et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17228638) or [Paschold et al. (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1352-2310(02)00969-X) or [Highsmith et al. (1988)](https://doi.org/10.1021/es00174a019) or [the EPA](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-08/documents/humidifier_factsheet.pdf) or [public health Ontario](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/e/2017/eb-humidifier-hc.pdf?la=en).) The VA [prohibits](https://www.va.gov/vhapublications/ViewPublication.asp?pub_ID=9181) ultrasonic humidifiers but allows steam.  So kill your damn ultrasonic humidifier.

# Epilogue: Counter-claims and why they're wrong

**"I'll just keep it clean"**

If the purifier is perfectly clean and you use distilled water, then there's no dissolved solids, and almost no particles are produced. This is basically what the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-08/documents/humidifier_factsheet.pdf) recommends: Use distilled water, and completely clean and dry the humidifier after every usage.

This is a bad strategy. For one thing, come on. You're going to use distilled water? Filtered water isn't good enough -- it still creates lots of particles, although less than tap water. For another, have you ever tried to clean a humidifier? Bacteria build-up seem to start within one day and once bacteria have taken hold appears to be almost impossible to fully remove them [(Grieble et al., 1970)](https://doi.org/10.1056/nejm197003052821003). The [NIH](https://idsa.confex.com/idsa/2014/webprogram/Paper45731.html) recommends only using an ultrasonic humidifier for *three days with distilled water*, after which the humidifier should be *thrown away*.

It just doesn't make sense to start with a fundamentally unsafe design and then go to crazy lengths to try to make it safe.

**The evolutionary argument**

Some types of particles are surely more dangerous than others. Maybe we evolved some robustness to particles that are naturally occurring like those from dust or sea spray, since our ancestors have been breathing those long before humans existed.

Maybe. But are you *sure*? The primary problem with this is again the insanely imbalanced risk-reward tradeoff. In any case, the argument is debatable. We never breathed these particles at the concentrations or for the amount of time that a humidifier next to your bed represents. Also, this argument just applies to the dissolved solids in water. In realistic conditions, you'll have bacteria growing in the water. What happens when you make particles out of these? Remember, the mechanism of harm seems to be that the foreign particles activate your immune system. Random bacteria growing in water would seem to be very foreign indeed.

**"Three years is no big deal"**

If you really don't mind, then OK. But I doubt this logic for three reasons. First of all, three years is a *lot*. Common estimates [value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_life) a year of life at around $100,000. Light smokers have a life expectancy something like five years less. If you worry about diet or exercise or whatever, then you should also care about humidifiers.

Second, you have many lifestyle choices you can make. If you spend a year here and a year there, pretty soon you're talking about real money.

Third, it's three years *in expectation* not exactly three years. Most of us are risk-averse and would consider a 25% chance of losing 12 years worse than a 100% chance of losing three. The distribution here is at least somewhat heavy-tailed.

Finally, imagine zooming forward to whatever point you might be getting an extra three years. Are you really sure you'd still feel the same way then? I respect the idea of not trying to live forever, but that's not really the issue here. Not to be morbid, but it's always easy to *subtract* time if you really want to. Option value is a positive thing.
