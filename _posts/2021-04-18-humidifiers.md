Kill your ultrasonic humidifier. I know this *seems* ridiculous, but the case is very simple:
* Breathing tiny airborne particles causes massive health problems.
* Ultrasonic humidifiers create lots of particles.
* While it's uncertain if the *particular* particles from ultrasonic humidifiers are harmful, the risk is insane compared to the benefit.

That's it. The current science says there's a real chance that using an ultrasonic humidifier could cut years from your life. It's not a sure thing, but it's a real risk. Use an evaporative or steam humidifier instead.

# Particles cause serious health problems

The evidence for this is [strong](https://dynomight.net/air/). Outdoor particle levels vary throughout the world and statistics link these levels to health problems including heart disease, strokes, kidney disease, respiratory infections, and lung cancer. The mechanism appears to be that tiny particles make their way through the lungs into the bloodstream and thus other parts of the body. These foreign particles then activate the immune system causing all sorts of havoc.

A good heuristic is that that an increase of 33.3 PM<sub>2.5</sub> μg/m³ costs around 1 disability adjusted life year. [Correia et al.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1097%2FEDE.0b013e3182770237) estimated something close to this from different counties in the US, and more recent data from many different countries [confirms this](https://dynomight.net/air/#a-heuristic-to-quantify-harms). The most polluted cities in the world have levels around 100 PM<sub>2.5</sub> μg/m³.

## Ultrasonic humidifiers create tons of particles

Ultrasonic humidifiers create tiny particles of water, including any dissolved solids. The water quickly evaporates, leaving the solids in the air. Tap water contains lots of minerals, but even if you use distilled or deionized water, you still have the problem that humidifiers are warm moist environments. Bacteria grow quickly in them, again ending up as tiny particles.

Ultrasonic humidifiers can easily push levels to several **hundred** μg/m³. If you used one for 8 hours a night and it created a level of 300 μg/m³, this would raise your average exposure by 100 μg/m³, meaning an expected cost of 3 disability adjusted life years.

> Ultrasonic humidifiers [...] create tiny droplets consisting of water and its impurities. Once the water evaporates, the impurities can remain suspended as airborne particles. One of the primary concerns for household humidifiers is their ability to aerosolize pathogenic microbes. [...] This white dust was associated with respiratory distress in children if inhaled

>  Ultrasonic humidifiers were found to have a substantial impact on home indoor concentrations and personal exposures for SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> as well as PM<sub>2.5</sub> , likely as the result of aerosolization of sulfates and other dissolved minerals present in the water. For the two subjects with ultrasonic humidifiers, personal SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and PM exposures were approximately two and five times greater, respectively, than corresponding ambient concentrations.

> When inhaled during an 8-hr exposure time, and depending on mineral water quality, humidifier aerosols can deposit up to 100 s of μg minerals in the human child respiratory tract and 3–4.5 times more μg of minerals in human adult respiratory tract. [...] Distilled water should be used whenever possible to prevent respiratory irritation (USEPA, 1991), although there is little indication that consumers are aware of or follow this consideration.

> The concentrations of metals/elements varies based on particle size and particle water content. Nonetheless, the same relative amounts of metals/elements are present in each particle. Thus, inhalation of small particles increased mass exposure to common tap water metals (e.g., calcium, sodium, magnesium), and also associated anions.

It isn't controversial. This is a thing that happens.


# The risk-reward ratio is insane

These calculations are uncertain. Our estimates for the harms particles cause are based on observational statistics, not randomized trials. Also, different types of particles surely cause different amounts of trouble, and we don't know how bad the kind humidifiers make are. But this uncertainty goes in both directions. The harms could be less than we estimate, or they could be even worse.

You might calculate the odds differently. Say you're 75% sure that ultrasonic humidifiers are harmless. Still, you still have to ask yourself if using an ultrasonic humidifier is worth the risk. Even a small probability of losing three years is something to take seriously.

Alternatively, you might *really* hate dry air. The good news is that steam or evaporative humidifiers cost $20-100, humidify the air just as well, and seem to create almost no particles. (See [Park et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17228638) or [Paschold et al. (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1352-2310(02)00969-X) or [Highsmith et al. (1988)](https://doi.org/10.1021/es00174a019) or [the EPA](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-08/documents/humidifier_factsheet.pdf) or [public health Ontario](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/e/2017/eb-humidifier-hc.pdf?la=en) or the [VA's](https://www.va.gov/vhapublications/ViewPublication.asp?pub_ID=9181) policy to prohibit ultrasonic humidifiers but allow steam.)

When there's a possibility of a large harm, you have to be *very* confident that the danger is not real to justify ignoring the issue.


# Epilogue: Counter-Claims

**Using deionized water and keeping the humidifier clean**

In principle, this could work. If there are absolutely no dissolved solids in the water, then no solid particles can be produced. This is basically what the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-08/documents/humidifier_factsheet.pdf) recommends: Use distilled water, and completely clean and dry the humidifier after every usage.

I don't think this is practical. For one thing, note that filtered water isn't good enough -- it still creates lots of particles, although less than tap water. And you're really going to clean and dry it every time?

More importantly, it's very hard to avoid bacteria buildup. It happens within days and once bacteria have really taken hold, they're almost impossible to fully remove [(Grieble et al., 1970)](https://doi.org/10.1056/nejm197003052821003). The [NIH](https://idsa.confex.com/idsa/2014/webprogram/Paper45731.html) recommends only using an ultrasonic humidifier for three days (with distilled water) and then *throwing it away*.

Why start with a fundamentally unsafe design, and then go to such lengths to try to make it safe?

**The evolutionary argument**

Some types of particles are surely more dangerous than others. Maybe we evolved some robustness to particles that are naturally occurring like those from dust or sea spray, since our ancestors have been breathing those long before humans existed.

Maybe, but are you *sure*? We never breathed particles at the concentrations or for the amount of time that a humidifier next to your bed represents. In any case, the bigger problem is still the insanely imbalanced risk-reward tradeoff. Unless you're *very* confident, you can't ignore the risk.
